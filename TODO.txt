2- Support for Infura
4- Telescope command and automatic abi decoding for opcodes 
   (e.g., CALL should have its ABI decoded automatically and dereference the offset in memory)
5- Formatting of text should be improved 
6- Disassembling of next instruction. We can do it through emulation.
7- Integration with ethpwn 
9- watchpoints on storage location or memory
11- import storage layout
12- support for multiple transactions
13- visualize history of callstack instead of just the current 
15- Add native binary for crypto to speed up the execution. 
17- If execution reverts inside a contract, the sstores should be removed!
20- Support execution of TX from top of block, end, or specific position (more advanced)
    - Executing always at the top might not work in some cases (balance of tokens for a contract)
21- Add explain to see where a value come from
22- We have to stub ecrecover and every freaking call that expects that the signer was actually a real account when impersonating.
23- Modifying storage and memory on demand
34- tag stack element
35- do a vmmap command to show current usage of the whole memory!
36- precise execution (gasPrice and sig verification ON)
