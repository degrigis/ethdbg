1- Sanitization of input for arguments 
2- Support for Infura
4- Telescope command and automatic abi decoding for opcodes 
   (e.g., CALL should have its ABI decoded automatically and dereference the offset in memory)
5- Formatting of text should be improved 
6- Disassembling of next instruction. We can do it through emulation.
7- Integration with ethpwn 
9- watchpoints on storage location or memory
11- import storage layout
12- support for multiple transactions
13- visualize history of callstack instead of just the current 
14- Support impersonation of accounts (skip private key check) (just set the msg.sender to specific address)
15- Add native binary for crypto to speed up the execution. 
16- Support break by specifying the contract in which you should be
17- If execution reverts inside a contract, the sstores should be removed!
20- Support execution of TX from top of block, end, or specific position (more advanced)
    - Executing always at the top might not work in some cases (balance of tokens for a contract)
21- Add explain to see where a value come from
22- We have to stub ecrecover and every freaking call that expects that the signer was actually a real account when impersonating.
