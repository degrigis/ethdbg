3- Doesn't work with Sepolia (it would be great if we can make it work with Infura)
4- Telescope command and automatic abi decoding for opcodes 
   (e.g., CALL should have its ABI decoded automatically and dereference the offset in memory)
5- Formatting of text should be improved 
6- Disassembling of next instruction. We can do it through emulation.
7- Integration with ethpwn 
8- Display constant in disassembly
9- watchpoints on storage location or memory
11- import storage layout
12- support for multiple transactions
13- visualize history of callstack instead of just the current 
14- Support impersonation of accounts (skip private key check) (just set the msg.sender to specific address)
15- Add native binary for crypto to speed up the execution. 
16- Support break by specifying the contract in which you should be
17- If execution reverts inside a contract, the sstores should be removed!
18- When I do start and the computation is done, restart it. If it's not at the end show a prompt!
19- [BUG] StubMemoryDB is not block aware, I tried to make block aware but then I cannot use my address, what is the best fix? @robert
20- Support execution of TX from top of block, end, or specific position (more advanced)
    - Executing always at the top might not work in some cases (balance of tokens for a contract)
